# CSS Build Troubleshooting

## Issue
Tailwind CSS styles are not appearing in the Docker build.

## Root Cause
The `postcss.config.js` file had the wrong configuration - it contained Tailwind config instead of PostCSS config.

## Fix Applied

1. **Fixed postcss.config.js**:
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

2. **Rebuild the Docker image**:

### Windows:
```cmd
fix-css-and-rebuild.bat
```

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
chmod +x fix-css-and-rebuild.sh
./fix-css-and-rebuild.sh
```

### Or manually:
```bash
# Stop and rebuild
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml build --no-cache
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d
```

## Verify the Fix

1. After rebuilding, check http://localhost:3001
2. You should see:
   - Dark theme (slate background)
   - Styled buttons and cards
   - Proper spacing and layout

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check build logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml logs
   ```

2. **Verify CSS is built**:
   - Look for `.css` files in the build output
   - Should see something like `dist/assets/index-[hash].css`

3. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

The key issue was the postcss.config.js file configuration. With the correct PostCSS config, Tailwind CSS should now be properly processed during the build.
