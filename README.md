- **Viewer**: Read-only access to tournament data

### Superuser Access

If you lose admin access:
1. Go to the tournament list page
2. Click "Superuser Login" in the footer
3. Enter the superuser password (found in `server/data/superuser-config.json`)
4. Gain admin access to any tournament

### Schedule Views

Access the Schedule tab to view:
- **By Round**: All games in each round
- **By Station**: Schedule for each game location
- **By Player**: Individual player schedules showing when and where to play

Print any view for posting at the venue.

2. Click winner team/player or "Draw"
3. Scores update in real-time across all devices

### Round Timer (Optional)

If enabled in settings:
1. Admin sets timer duration (1-120 minutes)
2. 5-second countdown synchronizes all devices
3. Visual and audio warnings at 5 minutes remaining

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

The built files will be in `client/dist/`

### Server Deployment

The server requires:
- Node.js runtime
- Write access to a data directory
- Port 3001 (or configure PORT environment variable)

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

## Data Management

### Backup Tournament Data
```bash
# Docker
docker run --rm -v tournament-manager_tournament-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar -czf /backup/tournament-backup.tar.gz -C /data .

# Local development
cp -r server/data server/data-backup
```

### Superuser Configuration

The superuser password is stored in `server/data/superuser-config.json`:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "password": "your-secure-password",
  "passwordHash": null
}
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Client (React) <-> API (Express) <-> File System (JSON)
                      |
                      v
                Server-Sent Events (Real-time updates)
```

### File Structure
```
tournament-manager/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/               # React frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # UI components

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js         # Main server file

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data/            # Tournament JSON files
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Admin Access
Use the superuser login feature from the tournament list page footer.

### Schedule Generation Fails
- Ensure all teams have the same number of active players
- Check that teams have enough players for all game types
- Verify at least one station per game type

### Docker Issues
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs tournament-manager

# Reset everything (WARNING: deletes all data)
docker-compose down -v
```
