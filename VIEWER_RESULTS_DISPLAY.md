# Viewer Game Results Display - COMPLETED

## Overview

Enhanced the GameCard component to show game results for viewers who don't have scoring permissions. Now viewers in "View Only" mode can see results as they come in, displayed prominently where the scoring buttons appear for admins/scorers.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Details

### **Visual Result Display for Viewers**
When users are in view-only mode (not admin or scorer), the GameCard now shows:

#### **For Completed Games:**
- **Prominent Result Badge**: Shows winner with üèÜ trophy emoji or ü§ù for draws
- **Gradient Background**: Eye-catching green gradient background
- **Animated Elements**: 
  - Bouncing checkmark icon
  - Pulsing glow effect behind the result
- **Clear Typography**: Bold, larger text for easy reading
- **Examples**: 
  - "üèÜ Team Alpha Wins!"
  - "üèÜ Team Beta Wins!"
  - "ü§ù Draw!"

#### **For Games In Progress:**
- **Status Indicator**: "Game in progress..." with pulsing yellow dot
- **Subtle Styling**: Less prominent to show ongoing status
- **Visual Feedback**: Pulsing animation indicates active game

### **Enhanced Game Cards**
All game cards now have improved visual feedback:
- **Completion Ring**: Completed games show a subtle green ring border
- **Header Enhancement**: "Complete" label with animated checkmark for finished games
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between active and completed games
